# Climate-Visibility-Prediction-for-Air-Traffic-Control

This project focuses on predicting climate visibility to aid air traffic control systems in making informed decisions related to aviation safety and operations. By utilizing weather data and predictive models, this project aims to provide accurate visibility predictions to enhance air traffic management and reduce the risk of accidents or delays due to poor visibility conditions.
